# What's www.conf

Pool Directives are a PHP-FPM convention where multiple "pools" 
of child processes can be started and have different configurations. 
The default name for the pool directives file is www.conf.

# Where
You can find this file in the default location
/etc/php/7.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

*I don't recommend do any modification to these files, 
unless you are pretty sure about where and what you are doing.
