# What's nginx ?
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS,
SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server
(origin server). The nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency, high
performance and low memory usage. It is licensed under the 2-clause BSD-like license and
it runs on Linux, BSD variants, Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, as well as on other 
*nix flavors. It also has a proof of concept port for Microsoft Windows.
